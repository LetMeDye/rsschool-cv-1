## **About Me**

I am a bachelor of computer science. My current job is a junior backend developer. I want to try my hand at the front-end because it seems to resonate with me. Before this enthusiasm fades, I want to learn as much as possible about front-end. I hope that over time this fuse to learn something new and improve my knowledge in this area will not go anywhere.
